    <h4>Rules for Autocomplet</h4>
    <h6><font color="grey"><i>Posted on March 19, 2019</i></h6>
    <br>
    <pre><h5><font color="black">Autocompleting text with known values seems an easy problem to solve,but so so so many Uls get it wrong. I see this frequently
enough that, rather than complain about them individuallyt, I thought I'd just down the set of rules they often break.
There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the best things to do, but there should be a good reason for breaking
one of these rules (for example, some of these rules don.t apply if a field must be fitted with a value from a fixed set,
like the list of US states). Following these rules should always result in at very least sane experience:
<br>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an opinion exactly, other	opinions must always go
below the one matching what they typed.</li>
	<li>Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type "Fr" I want "Frenso" not "San Francisco."</li>
	<li>After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting with substring matches would almost
always be the wrong thing to do since users start typing words at the begining not somewhere in the middle.</li>
	<li>If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall back to approximate matches. This is
rarely neccessary to provid.</li>
	<li>Matches should be sorted alphabetically.</li>
	<li>When one option is the prefix or another, put the <i>shortest one first.</i></li>
	<li>The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are two options that differ only by case. In that case
(pun intended), prefer the one that more closely matches the user's input.</li>
	<li>The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term) must be a different key than the action
to accept the first suggestion <i>unless</i> you have to do something first to start using autocomplete suggestions
(e.g. hit the down arrow). The user should have to take extra steps to <i>not</i> use autocomplete.</li>
</ul></h5></pre>
